Abstract. We model PoS validation as a strategic game in which validators maximize risk-adjusted utility rather than raw rewards. Linear rewards face convex costs (ops, correlated slashing, market penalties), yielding a finite interior optimum stake share and a decentralized equilibrium. We derive comparative statics and discuss calibration for Ethereum/Cosmos; we show how diversity tech reduces risk convexity, expanding safe capacity without centralization.
